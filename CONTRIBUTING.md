# Contributing to Cost Intelligence Agency

I'm one person with relatively little idea how to actually make this work. I'm going to implement this the best I can even if I have to learn each step.

But this will be better with help.

We're recruiting volunteers now. This is an open source, volunteer-driven project to bring price transparency to opaque markets, starting with healthcare.

## What We Need

### Technical Roles
- **Mobile developers** (React Native, iOS, or Android)
- **Backend developers** (API, database)
- **ML/Data specialists** (OCR, validation)
- **DevOps** (infrastructure, deployment)
- **Security reviewers** (cryptography, privacy architecture)
- **Documentation writers** (technical docs, user guides)

### Non-Technical Roles
- **UX/UI designers** (mobile app, web interface)
- **Graphic designers** (branding, marketing materials)
- **Guerrilla marketers** (grassroots outreach, social media)
- **Community moderators** (review submissions, maintain quality)
- **Content writers** (blog posts, explainers, advocacy)
- **Data contributors** (share your bills to seed the database)

## What We Have

- **Clear mission with real impact** - Saves people money, fights price opacity
- **Real data ready** - Founder and volunteer bills to seed database
- **Funded infrastructure** - $100/month budget committed
- **Domain and brand** - costintelagency.org
- **Committed leadership** - Founder with clear vision
- **Privacy-first architecture** - Zero-knowledge, subpoena-resistant
- **Open source from day one** - Community-owned, can't be bought out

## What We're Building

- **Something that matters** - Saves people money, fights financial exploitation
- **Something transparent** - Open source, auditable, community-owned
- **Something lasting** - Can't be shut down or bought out
- **Something you'll be proud of** - Real impact on real people's lives

## Time Commitment

**Reality check:** This is volunteer work in spare time
- Do what you can
- MVP timeline: TBD
- Looking for people who can commit for months, not weeks
- Async communication across time zones
- Understanding when life happens and people need breaks

## Our Values

1. **Privacy is non-negotiable** - Zero-knowledge architecture, users control their data
2. **Quality over quantity** - Better to move slowly and build it right
3. **Transparency** - Open source code, public decision-making, honest about limitations
4. **Community ownership** - No single point of failure, collaborative governance
5. **Impact focus** - We're here to help real people, not build cool tech for its own sake

## How to Get Involved

**Contact:** costintelagency@proton.me

**Tell us:**
- What role(s) interest you
- Relevant experience or skills
- Time you can realistically commit
- Why this project matters to you
- Your timezone (for coordination)

**No experience required for:**
- Data contributors (share your bills)
- Community moderators (after you learn the system)
- Guerrilla marketing (passion and creativity matter most)
- User testing (give feedback on prototypes)

## What Happens Next

1. **Initial conversation** - Chat about the project, your interests, fit
2. **Onboarding** - Get access to repos, docs, communication channels
3. **Start small** - Pick up a manageable first task
4. **Iterate** - Work at your pace, ask questions, collaborate
5. **Grow with the project** - Take on more as you're comfortable
