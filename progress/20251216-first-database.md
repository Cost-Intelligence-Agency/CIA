# First Database Setup - December 16, 2025

## What I Did
- Set up Supabase account and project
- Created schema: facilities, users, submissions tables
- Inserted fabricated test data (3 procedures)
- Ran pricing intelligence queries

## What Worked
- Supabase SQL Editor is straightforward
- Schema design holds up with real-ish data
- Queries return useful intelligence

## What's Next
