# First Real Data Entry - December 17, 2025

## Accomplishments
- Deployed schema v2.1 with multi-line EOB support
- Created SQL helper functions for easier data entry
- Entered 4 facilities (UC San Diego + 3 CPAP suppliers)
- Entered 2 first complete EOBs: UCSD MRI (Feb 2025) and Advanced CPAP supplies (Mar 2025)

## Key Finding
UCSD MRI: Billed $11,401, TRICARE paid $453.77 = 96% discount
- This is what uninsured patients face vs. actual negotiated rates
- 2 procedures bundled/denied as incidental

## Database Status
- 1 bill with 3 line items
- 16 EOBs remaining
- Helper functions working perfectly

## Next Session
- Enter remaining 16 EOBs
- Should take ~30-45 minutes with helper functions
- Run queries to see pricing patterns across procedures

## What I Learned
- Revenue codes vs CPT codes vs HCPCS codes
- Hospital bundling practices
- SQL functions make data entry WAY easier
- Real bills are messier than design docs suggest
